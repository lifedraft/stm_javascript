Stores JavaScript files within the database and handles them similar to CSS files.

In admin section, go to tab “presentation > javascript” and create one ore more javascript files that you want to embed within your page templates. This is similiar to the “styles” tab – the JavaScript files get stored in the database and you can embed them with a new Textpattern tag:

<txp:js /> (embeds default JavaScript file) 
<txp:js n="myDomScript" /> (embeds JavaScript file named "myDomScript")

Output:
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://mysite.com/?js=myDomScript"></script>
